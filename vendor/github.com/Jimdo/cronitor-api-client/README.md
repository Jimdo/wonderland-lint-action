# cronitor-api-client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Jimdo/cronitor-api-client.svg?token=1djnvUyMgtcVefCz54T4&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Jimdo/cronitor-api-client)

[Cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io/) client for the Monitor API ([Reference](https://cronitor.io/docs/monitor-api)) via swagger.

Currently this project only generates a Go client, but the swagger definition might be used for other languages as well. For anything swagger-codegen related see the official [Documentation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

The generated Go client in this project uses [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) rather than the 'official' swagger codegen project.
